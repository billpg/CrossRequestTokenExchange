    <h1>Cross Request Token Exchange</h1>
    <p>This website implements each side of the exchange, in a way that you can test against your own web service.</p>

    <p>See <a href="https://github.com/billpg/CrossRequestTokenExchange">this project's github</a> for a full description of the exchange.</p>

    <h2>Issuer</h2>

    <p>This section is for your service to act as the <b>Initiator</b> and this service will act as the <b>Issuer</b>. You code will make a PPOST request to thi service and we'll respond by making a separate POST request back to your service with the newly issued Bearer token. There's a separate end-point that will test you have a valid Bearer token.
