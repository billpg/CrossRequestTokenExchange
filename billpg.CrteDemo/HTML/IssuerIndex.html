		<h1>Issuer Demo.</h1>
		<p>This is the issuer demo. This server will act as the <i>Issuer</i> while yours will act as the <i>Initiator</i>.</p>

		<p>CRTE normally requires a pre-existing relationship between the two participants. As that won't be possible for this demo, please set up a <a href="/GrantPermission/"><tt>billpg-com-crte.json</tt></a> file on your website before starting.

		<p>Once that file is in place, we need to know the URL to send the <i>TokenIssue</i> POST requests to. Fill this in here and click the Start button. The next page will return the URL on this server for you to send your POST request to.</p>

			<table border="0" width="90%">
				<tr><td>POST URL:</td><td><input name="TokenIssuePostUrl" width="80%" /></td></tr>
				<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="right"><input type="submit" value="Start"></td></tr>
