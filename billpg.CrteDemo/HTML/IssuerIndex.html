		<h1>Issuer Demo.</h1>
		<p>This is the issuer demo. This service will act as the <i>Issuer</i> while yours will act as the <i>Initiator</i>.</p>

		<p>Have your service make a POST request according to <a href="https://github.com/billpg/CrossRequestTokenExchange/blob/main/README.md">the description in the project's github</a> to this URL:

        <p class="apiurl">https://<Host />/Issuer/TokenCall</p>

		<p>This request will include your URL to a hash of your JSON request. Please note that if this service detects a large number of failed requests, it will return a 429 error indicating its refusal to participate.</p>

		<p>If the request is successful, the response will include a Bearer token. You may validate this token by using it with a GET request tp this URL:</p>

		<p class="apiurl">https://<Host/>/Issuer/TokenTest</p>

		<p>If you have any issues, please open a ticket in <a href="https://github.com/billpg/CrossRequestTokenExchange/">this project's github.</a></p>
